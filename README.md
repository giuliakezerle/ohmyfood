# ohmyfood
Ohmyfood is a new startup that wants to make a name for itself in the restaurant business. The objective is to develop a 100% mobile-friendly site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to having a classic reservation system, customers will be able to select the dishes they want for their meal so that they are ready when they arrive. No more wait times in restaurants!

## Brand
**Graphic Identity**
1. Fonts:
   - Logo and Titles: Shrikhand

## Operations
**Technologies**
  * The development will have to be in CSS, without JavaScript;
  * No framework should be used; however, Sass would be a plus;
  * No CSS code should be applied via a style attribute in an HTML tag.

**Compatibility**
  * Mobile-first approach;
  * Responsive on tablet and desktop (developer defines the layout);
  * The pages will have to pass W3C validation in HTML and CSS without errors;
  * The site must be fully compatible with the latest desktop versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

## Deliverables
**Page Content**
  * Homepage (x1)
    * Display the location of restaurants;
    * A short presentation of the company; 
    * A section containing the four menus in the form of cards. When clicking on the card, the user is redirected to the menu page;

  * Menu Pages (x4)
    * Four pages each containing a restaurant menu;

  * Footer
    * Identical on all pages;
    * When you click on Contact, a link to an email address is made;

   * Header
     * Present on all pages;
     * The home page contains the logo of the site;
     * The menu pages contain a button to return to the home page;

**Graphic Effects and Animations (CSS only, no Java or library)**
  * Buttons
    * When hovering, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The drop shadow should also be more visible;
    * The heart-shaped like button should fill up gradually when hovering;
  
  * Home Page
    * When the application has more menus, a loading spinner will be necessary. It will have to appear for 1 to 3 seconds when you arrive on the home page, cover the whole screen, and use CSS animations (no library);

  * Menu Pages
    * When arriving on the page, the dishes should appear gradually with a slight time lag. They may appear either one by one or by group Starter, Main course, and Dessert;
    * The visitor can add the dishes he wishes to his order by clicking on them. A small checkmark will appear to the right of the dish. This tick should slide from right to left. For this first version, the effect can be displayed on hovering on desktop instead of clicking. If the title of the dish is too long, it will have to be trimmed with suspension points.
